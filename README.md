# kiwi
Kiwi (/ˈkiːwi/ KEE-wee) or kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries).


## End of life announcement
Kiwi was an early personal project which taught me a lot. However, it was lacking in terms of architecture and was badly written. I've decided to reboot the idea in another iteration of kiwi - [kiwii](https://github.com/vlad-pbr/kiwii) (as in kiwi II).


## Get kiwi
If you're still willing to play around with it:
```
# requirements: python3 and pip3

mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-pbr/kiwi/master/kiwi > $HOME/.local/bin/kiwi
chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/kiwi
```
